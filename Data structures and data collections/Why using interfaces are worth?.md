# Why using interfaces are worth?

Everyone knows that using interfaces help us ex. mocking, DI (Dependency injection), hiding implementation or multiple implementation. I want to focus on multiple implementations in collections.

Why using interfaces instead of classes are worth in project? Because we can use everyone collection which implementing that interface.

However sometimes use classes instead interfaces, they have important thing. When we want to focus on immutable implementation and want to specific implementation.

So, it depends on situation, but worth is knowing why using interfaces are worth too.
