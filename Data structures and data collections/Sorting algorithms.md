There is a lot of sorting algorithms but today I focus only basic which we use everyday in own application.

I recommend this page: [Data structure visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html)

[Visualizing step by step how to work sorting algorithms](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html)

All basic algorithms:
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Counting sort
- Radix sort
- Bucket sort

Algorithms are important because they fast our code.
On the page is clearly and simply presentation sorting algorithms.

The interesting book:
- Grokking Algorithms, Second Edition
