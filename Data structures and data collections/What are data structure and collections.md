# What are data structure?
I quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) source:

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.

So data structure is good option when we want to use from structure which were tested and optimized of focusing performance. Yes, we can create own structure or override existing structure yet. Often to create new structure with override basic methods.

# So, what are data collections?
I also quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_(abstract_data_type)) source:

>In computer programming, a **collection** is an abstract data type that is a grouping of items that can be used in a polymorphic way.

Easily way, collection is an abstract data type which has methods which execute definite tasks. Ex. sort collection or find in collection.
Each collections have different implementation and each collections have other [Algorithmic Complexity](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Algorithmic%20Complexity/complexity.html). The best option is O(1) and the worst is O(n!).

> O(n!) is a travelling salesman problem.
