# Hello!

My name is Dominik. I'm from Poland and now I'm IT student. 
I have started to programming since 2022.
I have been .NET Developer since 2023. I focus on architecture solutions and perform applications. I prefer minimalism philosophy in life and work. In free time I ride a motorcycle and read non-fiction books.

What are you finding in my blog? I'm going to focus on architecture and optimization solutions and deep-dive in C# language.
I hope that you stay a long time.

If you want to contact me. I propose Linkedin!
